# Advent of Code 2023

_Avent of Code is a fun yearly challenge each advent,_
_where much like an Advent-calendar, programmers receive_
_daily programming challanges and collect stars_

## Motivation

I have been meaning to learn go for a long time now, but
I've never had the opportunity to start a side-project with
it, which is my go-to for trying out new stuff.

Although this end of the year is very busy for me I will
try to stick to solving these small puzzles as my time permits.
